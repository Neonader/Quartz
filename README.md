# Quartz
An elegant JVM-based hobby programming language.

## Introduction
Quartz is a side project started in August 2024, but it has been on my mind for longer than that.
I want to learn how to "make" a programming language, from syntax to compiler, even to other tools such as extensions.

The documentation is divided into the following sections:
* [Language reference](LanguageReference.md) defines the grammar and features of Quartz
* [Getting started](GettingStarted.md) explains how to use Quartz

The inner workings of the Quartz compiler are described with KDoc comments throughout the source code.
