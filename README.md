# Quartz
An elegant, JVM-based, hobby programming language.

## Introduction
Quartz is a side project started in August 2024, but it has been on my mind for longer than that.
I wanted to learn how to "make" a programming language, from syntax to compiler to other tools such as extensions.

The documentation is divided into the following sections:
* [Language reference](LanguageReference.md) defines the grammar and features of Quartz
* [Workings](Workings.md) explains the inner workings of the Quartz compiler
* [Getting started](GettingStarted.md)
